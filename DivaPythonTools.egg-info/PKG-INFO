        # Diva Python Tools
        
        A set of python modules to help users with
        1. the preparation of the Diva input files: data, contours, parameters;
        2. the execution of the Diva interpolation tool,
        3. the reading of output files (analysis, finite-element mesh),
        4. the input and output plotting.
        
        ## Getting started 
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        The [Diva](https://github.com/gher-ulg/diva) interpolation tool has to be installed and compiled on your machine. See the related [documentation](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA/blob/master/README.md#installing) for the installation.
        
        ### Installing
        
        Clone the package:
        ```bash
        git clone git@github.com:gher-ulg/DivaPythonTools.git
        ```
        or download the latest stable [release](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DivaPythonTools/releases).
        
        Inside DivaPythonTools directory execute:
        ```python
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        After this you should use it as:
        ```python
        from pydiva import pydiva2d, pydiva4d
        ```
        
        ## Module description
        
        The main modules are [`pydiva2d`](./pydiva2d.py) and [`pydiva4d`](./pydiva4D.py), which define the classes for the 2D and 4D version of Diva, respectively.
        
        ### pydiva2d
        
        The module defines classes corresponding to the main Diva input (data, parameters, contours) and output files (analysed and error fields, finite-element mesh).
        
        ### pydiva4d
        
        The module defines classes to run the 4D version of Diva.
        
        ## Plots
        
        The figures can be generated with and without the [Basemap](https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap) module (Plot on map projections). 
        
        Some examples obtained with mixed-layer depth (MLD) data are shown below. The complete example to generate these plots is inside the Notebooks directory [(run_diva2D_MLD)](./Notebooks/run_diva2D_MLD.ipynb).
        
        The [Notebooks](./Notebooks) directory contains additional examples showing how to run 2D and 4D cases.
        
        ### Data values
        Scatter plot showing the data positions and values.    
        ![Data](./figures/datapoints.png)
        
        ### Contours
        By default, each sub-contour is displayed in a different color.     
        ![Contour](./figures/contours.png)
        
        ### Finite-element mesh
        Triangular mesh covering the region of interest.     
        ![Mesh](./figures/mesh.png)
        
        ### Analysed fields
        Pseudo-color plot of the gridded field obtained by the interpolation.     
        ![Analysis](./figures/analysis.png)
        
        ### Combined information
        Data, contours, mesh and analysis on the same figure.

        ## Acknowledgments
        
        [Diva](https://github.com/gher-ulg/DIVA) developments have benefited from the users' feedback and numerous comments, especially during the editions of the Diva workshops.
        
        The present module was initiated in the frame of [SeaDataCloud](SeaDataCloud) project.
